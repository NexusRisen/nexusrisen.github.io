## Projects

### Pokemon Sysbots

My primary focus is developing and maintaining **Pokemon Sysbots** - automated systems for Pokemon games on Nintendo Switch. These bots help players with:

- **Trading Automation** - Streamlined trade bots for distributing Pokemon
- **Raid Hosting** - Automated raid hosting for community events
- **Egg Hatching & Breeding** - Efficient breeding automation
- **Shiny Hunting** - Automated encounters for shiny Pokemon

The sysbots run on custom firmware and leverage sys-botbase to interact with Pokemon games, providing valuable services to the Pokemon community.
